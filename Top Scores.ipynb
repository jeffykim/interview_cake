    "You created a game that is more popular than Angry Birds.\n",

    "Each round, players receive a score between 0 and 100, which you use to rank them from highest to lowest. So far you're using an algorithm that sorts in O(n\\lg{n})O(nlgn) time, but players are complaining that their rankings aren't updated fast enough. You need a faster sorting algorithm.\n",

    "Write a function that takes:\n",
    "\n",
    "a list of unsorted_scores\n",
    "the highest_possible_score in the game\n",
    "and returns a sorted list of scores in less than O(n\\lg{n})O(nlgn) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  unsorted_scores = [37, 89, 41, 65, 91, 53]\n",

    "\n",
    "We’re defining nn as the number of unsorted_scores because we’re expecting the number of players to keep climbing.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, we'll treat highest_possible_score as a constant instead of factoring it into our big O time and space costs because the highest possible score isn’t going to change. Even if we do redesign the game a little, the scores will stay around the same order of magnitude."
